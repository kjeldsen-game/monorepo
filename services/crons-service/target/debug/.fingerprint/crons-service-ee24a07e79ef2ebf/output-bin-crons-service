If using Cargo, add it to `[dependencies]`\n  in Cargo.toml.\n- The crate is present, but under a different name. If using Cargo, look for\n  `package = ` under `[dependencies]` in Cargo.toml.\n\n## Common causes for missing `std` or `core`\n\n- You are cross-compiling for a target which doesn't have `std` prepackaged.\n  Consider one of the following:\n  + Adding a pre-compiled version of std with `rustup target add`\n  + Building std from source with `cargo build -Z build-std`\n  + Using `#![no_std]` at the crate root, so you won't need `std` in the first\n    place.\n- You are developing the compiler itself and haven't built libstd from source.\n  You can usually build it with `x.py build library/std`. More information\n  about x.py is available in the [rustc-dev-guide].\n\n[rustc-dev-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html#building-the-compiler\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":13,"byte_end":30,"line_start":2,"line_end":2,"column_start":1,"column_end":18,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"extern crate log;","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":18}],"label":"can't find crate","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0463]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: can't find crate for `log`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0msrc/main.rs:2:1\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m2\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0mextern crate log;\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mcan't find crate\u001b[0m\n\n"}

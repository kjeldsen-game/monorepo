## Event-Sourcing
We are using an Event-Sourcing architecture for following key points:
- Data become the number one level citizen, every single action that occurs in the system gets stored in the form of an event
- The performance of the system will keep a good shape in the long term
- The scalability of the project, both vertically and horizontally will be easy to implement
- The project will be stateless, so the Continuous Deployment, Orchestration, and Containerization are easy to implement
- Events are the final source of truth. Aggregates (views) will be built to always return the most up to date version of an entity.

## CQRS
The structure of the project follows a CQRS pattern https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html

## Hexagonal Architecture
The structure of the project follows a hexagonal architecture where domain defines the entities and the business logic and adapters connect to any external piece.

## Local Development environment

In the folder local-env you can find a project that allows developers to replicate the entire platform quite easy. It is based on Docker Compose and will run up all services and databases needed to work. Read the README of the projects for more information.

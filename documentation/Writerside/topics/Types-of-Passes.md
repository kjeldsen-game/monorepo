# Pass Mechanics

<primary-label ref="wip"/>

Passing is a fundamental gameplay mechanic that governs the movement of the ball between players.

## Types of Passes

### High Pass
**Effect:**  
The pass is aerial, aiming to maximize the passer's **Aerial Ability (Ae)**. It only affects the **ball control duel**; the **positioning duel** remains unchanged.

- **For the attacker:**  
  Effective skill = *(Ae + Ball Control) / 2*
- **For the defender:**  
  Effective skill = *(Ae + Tackling) / 2*

### Low Pass
**Effect:**  
The pass is standard, aiming to maximize the passer's **Ball Control (BC)**. It only affects the **ball control duel**; the **positioning duel** remains unchanged.

- **For the attacker:**  
  Effective skill = *Ball Control (BC)*
- **For the defender:**  
  Effective skill = *Tackling (TA)*

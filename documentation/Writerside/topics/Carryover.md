# Carryover

<primary-label ref="wip"/>

The result of any duel **carries over** to the next action, influencing subsequent duels.

## Carryover Formula
- **Positive carryover:** Benefits the defender
- **Negative carryover:** Benefits the attacker

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Assistance in Defense
- **Active Attacker (OP):** 70
- **Active Defender (DP):** 65
- **Net Assistance:** +10 (in favor of defense)

**Application of Assistance:**
- Add 5 points to **DP** to match the attacker’s OP:  
  `DP = 65 + 5 = 70`
- Add the remaining 5 points to **TA**:  
  `TA = TA + 5`

---

### Example 2: Assistance in Offense
- **Active Attacker (OP):** 60
- **Active Defender (DP):** 65
- **Net Assistance:** -10 (in favor of offense)

**Application of Assistance:**
- Add 6 points to **OP** to surpass the defender’s DP:  
  `OP = 60 + 6 = 66`
- Add the remaining 4 points to **BC**:  
  `BC = BC + 4`

---

### Example 3: Carryover Effect
- **Net Result of Duel:** -12 (offensive advantage)
- **Carryover:** ½ × -12 = -6

The next action starts with the attacker having a **-6 advantage** carried over.

## Summary Table

| Net Assistance | Bonus Application              |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Positive (Defense) | Add to DP, then TA          |
| Negative (Offense) | Add to OP, then BC          |
| Zero             | No bonus                     |

The system ensures that **team support impacts duels** while applying **diminishing returns** to prevent excessive advantages.

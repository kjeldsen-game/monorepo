# Pitch Areas and Player Actions

<primary-label ref="wip"/>

The football field is divided into several areas, each of which determines the actions that players can take based on their positions. 
These areas are numbered from the perspective of the attacking team, and the attacking and defending zones are linked. Each zone has specific 
roles and actions available to players depending on their location on the field.

## Pitch Area Layout

The pitch is divided into **9 zones**, with each zone representing a different part of the field:

- **Defensive Zones:** 1, 2, 3
- **Midfield Zones:** 4, 5, 6
- **Attacking Zones:** 7, 8, 9

### Groupings of Pitch Areas

#### Horizontal Groupings
- **Defence:** Zones 1, 2, 3
- **Midfield:** Zones 4, 5, 6
- **Attack:** Zones 7, 8, 9

#### Vertical Groupings
- **Left Side:** Zones 1, 4, 7
- **Centre:** Zones 2, 5, 8
- **Right Side:** Zones 3, 6, 9

## Attacking and Defending Zones Relationship

- **Attacking Zone 8 = Defending Zone 2**
- **Attacking Zone 7 = Defending Zone 3**

The attacking and defending zones are mirrored, which means actions in the attacking zones correlate directly to movements in the corresponding defending zones.

## Available Actions Per Zone

Each area of the field restricts the type of actions players can take. The following describes the basic actions available based on a player’s position in a specific zone.

### Defensive Zones (1, 2, 3)
- **Primary Actions:** Defend, pass, clear the ball
- **Limited Actions:** Players in the defensive zones cannot shoot to score

### Midfield Zones (4, 5, 6)
- **Primary Actions:** Pass, tackle, support attack, defend
- **Limited Actions:** Players in midfield zones typically can’t shoot on goal unless they move into attacking areas

### Attacking Zones (7, 8, 9)
- **Primary Actions:** Pass to the penalty area, shoot, dribble, cross
- **Limited Actions:** Players in the attacking zones can pass across the field but cannot pass to opposite flanks mid

### Flanks (Left and Right)
- **Primary Actions:** Pass across the field, pass forward, cross into the penalty box
- **Limited Actions:** Players on the flanks cannot shoot from these areas unless they advance towards the goal
